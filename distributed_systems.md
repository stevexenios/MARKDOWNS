# Distributed Systems

These are connected systems that are composed of computers, computer components and software, which interact with each other and share the system's' resources. They are connected using a Local Area Network or Wide Area Network. Could be composed of any number of possible configurations, for example:

* Workstations
* Personal computers
* Mainframes, etc.

## Advantages of Distributed Computing

1. **Reliability** *(*fault tolerance*)*: The system remains operating despite some machines failing.
2. **Scalability**: Easy scalable, by adding more machines as needed.
3. **Resource sharing**: The system facilitates sharing of its resouces between and with connected applications.
4. **Flexibility**: System is very easy to debug, implement new services and make new installations.
5. **Speed**: The increased computation potential afforded by all connected components increases the  speed of transactions accordingly.
6. **Open system**: As it is open system, every service is equally accessible to every client, i.e. local or remote.
7. **Performance**: Collection of processors in the system can provid higher performance (and better price/performance ratio) than a centralized computer.

## Disadvantages of Distributed Computing

1. **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing the source of problems could be hard.
2. **Software**: Less software support.
3. **Networking**: Several issues could arise due to network issues, including:
   * Transmission issues
   * Loss of data
   * Overloading
4. **Security**: Ease of accessing other parts of system or data is increased by the number of connected components, hence decreasing security.

## Scalability

This is the ability of a system to expand and meet the needs of the business. For instance, scaling Facebook would entail ensuring that all the people using it as well as those who want to use it can be accommodated, even if it surpasses billions of people.

**a. Vertical scaling (_Scale Up_):** Adding resources within the same logical unit to increase capacity. For example, increasing the number of CPUs to an existing server, or increasing the memory in the system's servers or expanding storage by adding hard drive.

**b. Horizontal scaling (_Scale Out_):** This means adding more nodes to the system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. In NoSQL system, data store can be much faster as it takes advantages of **_scaling out_** which would entail adding more nodes to a system and distribute the load over those nodes.
